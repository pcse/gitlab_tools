# WebCAT Only - Not distributed to students!

* Copy the sample `webcat/` folder into the WebCAT Git repo for the course
 * The tests folder has a WebCAT specific version of `test_say_it.py` that balances points awarded.
* Create an assignment under the WebCAT course
  * From the `.gitlab-ci.yml` our course is ``CPSC 250``
  * the assignment should be named ``w1-hello-world-f19``
  * Modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` as needed for your naming convention
* Under WebCAT, point the `Instructor Reference Tests` to the `webcat` folder
* Remove the `webcat/` folder from the sample project before distributing to students
* Enjoy!
